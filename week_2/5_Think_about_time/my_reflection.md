# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 

I'm fortunately only working two long days a week during phase 0, so I feel like I have a fair amount of time to devote to DBC. The only time management challenge I have is balancing my social life with my DBC responsibilities. It's difficult to plan ahead when I'm not sure how long each of the challenges will take me. 

* How will you combat that? 
So far I've been setting aside a couple of days in the week to focus on the phase 0 material. I find I'm able to get a lot of the background reading done while I'm at work.

* What techniques will you try?
Time management has not been as issue for me in the past, but I was interested to read about changing or developing new habits. Before I moved to San Francisco this month I rowed with a team on the Petaluma river. I need to find new ways to exercise, and I'm finding that without the motivation of having other people depend on me to get a boat on the water it's much harder to set aside the time to go to the gym or get on the rowing machine. So I'm interested to try some of the suggestions for developing new habits by changing small bits of behavior at a time.
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
My overall plan to set aside MWF during the day for Phase 0 preparation, and have either Saturday or Sunday as an overflow day where I don't have any set plans. That way I'm free to make plans with friends for the evenings and at least one weekend day.
