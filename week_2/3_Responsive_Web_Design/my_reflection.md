# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

responsive web design is the practice of adjusting your website to the size constraints of different devices to give users an optimal experience. I like the idea of it, but the practice means that you are essentially designing multiple versions of a website to accomodate the different devices. Even with the extra work, I think it's an important element to consider in web design as more and more people use different devices to view webpages.

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?

The two contstraints of tablets and smartphones is their smaller viewport size, and the fact that they can view webpages in both portrait and landscape orientation. I know that I appreciate when sites have a mobile specific design for my phone as it makes it much easier to use. 

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?

visually impaired people use screen readers to use the web. It makes sense to design for them as the changes necessary to accomodate how screen readers interact with web pages are simple to make, such as always adding alt text for important images. 

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

I'm still working through how to construct the basic layout of a page using html and css. In order to construct effective media queries, I had to figure out which parts of the css where determining the layout, and that helped me understand how to construct a layout more effectively. In particular it was helpful to see examples of how using percentages instead of fixed pixel widths made elements on the page more responsive to resizing the screen.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
