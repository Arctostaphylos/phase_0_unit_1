# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: Arctostaphylos.github.io

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience?
From the reading, it sounds like designing for user experience in the real world of limited budgets and deadlines is somewhat limited. In an ideal world there would be time and money for research into the user experience, but in practice this is limited. In terms of reading about design, I learned that it's really helpful to look at other webpages for inspiration and design ideas, and that it's also helpful to think about the flow of a design. By flow I mean how the user's eye traverses the page. A good design will have a clear path to follow, and will put important elements where they are easy to find and use.

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

I find design to be the most challenging part of the process. The implementation of the design is much more up my alley. I feel like I can recognize good design, but actually creating it is very challenging.

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

I put together a very simple plan of what I wanted to include on the website, and then sketched a very skeletal wireframe. I think I would have better success translating my vision to reality if I had used a grid to really nail down the proportions of the different elements.

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

My site is not particularly responsive, as I did that exercise last after doing the solo challenge. I would like to make it more responsive to different size viewports. I'd also like to add more content - I think part of my challenge was not having a clear idea of what I wanted to include or present.

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

I'm still wrapping my mind around how to position elements on the page. I find I have a sort of guess and check approach that isn't very efficient.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I've found the book "Learning Web Design" by Jennifer Robbins to be a really useful reference.
