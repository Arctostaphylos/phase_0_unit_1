# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
I think web standards are necessary given the nature of the internet. Web standards provide a framework for companies and individuals to work with to make websites that function for everyone.

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?

Yes, the standard structure makes sense. It's a way of outlining the information to organize the content. I like the idea of marking up the different content to reflect a sort of hierarchy of information.

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

I think the new elements are useful, and eliminate the need for special classes or id's in the markup.


* Why is reset.css necessary? 

I didn't see any difference when I included the reset.css. I know from the reading that it's supposed reduce inconsistencies in how browsers display different elements, such as headings or line heights.

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

I use Firefox primarily, and occasionally Safari or Chrome. I find it really irritating that different websites look different in different browsers. As a potential designer, it just adds to the complexity of a project if the website displays differently in different browsers.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
