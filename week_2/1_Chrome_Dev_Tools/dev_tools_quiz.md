##QUIZ
* Explain which tabs support the following actions and how.
  * Realtime editing of HTML and CSS 
  The elements panel shows the html on the left and the corresponding CSS on the right in the styles panel. Changes you make here are not changing the original source - to do that you have to use the source panel to edit the source and then save it. 
  * Javascript Debugging
  Debugging happens in the console panel. In the console you can run snippets of code to see what they return. The console will also display error messages and direct you to the line in the script that generated the error. You can mark points in the script where you want to pause and then step through the script. When the script is paused you can examine the values of different variables, etc. at that point in the running of the script. 
  * Performance Optimization 
  The network panel allows you to see the different resources that are loaded by a page. The panel shows the size of the resource, how quickly it loads, and the order in which resources load. It also can show you resources that didn't load properly.

* What's the quick key for your OS to spawn the Dev Tools inspector?

Control + Command + I

* Go to http://www.postmachina.com/ and analyze and tweak this nicely designed page.
  * What is the current background color for the page?  (Surprisingly, it's not just black!)

  * Tweak the background color to white.
  * Tweak the height of the side bar that contains the logo.  Shrink it down to 85px.
  * Roll over the navigation links.  When you hover over them, they dissapear.  Let's change the hover color to black instead.
  * Now take a screenshot of your new (and maybe not so improved) design.  It should match this screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/5ak1jkpl5/
  * Upload your own image to the web using an image hosting service.  It should match the image above. The last nav link in the image above is black because the mouse was hovering there when the screenshot was taken. Do the same, and don't take a screenshot of your whole desktop, just the browser window. (This is part of the challenge.)

* For the postmachina website, why can't you tweak the color of the text "The most important things are not things"?  Please explain.

That text is part of an image and isn't generated by the html, so you can't edit it.

* Go to www.ticketswizard.com and analyze the page.  
  * What is the largest image on the website? 
  * Explain how you would find out this information, and list the URL of offending image here and how big it is.
  The largest image is http://www.ticketswizard.com/Images/Catalog/92624182-c482-4a35-8da2-4fbf2f502e94_Large_Large.png and it is 316 KB

  I found this out by using the network panel and sorting all the resources by size.

* Test the www.ticketswizard.com website with google's [PageSpeed Insights](http://www.ticketswizard.com/).  (You can also download the chrome plugin).  What is the lowest hanging fruit to optimize the website?  How many kilobytes of data can be eliminated?

The first suggestion is to optimise the images on the site to reduce their size by 885.9KB.
