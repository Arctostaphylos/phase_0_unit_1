# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?

The Document Object Model is a hierarchical structure that allows us to access and manipulate the contents of a document. It's used by the browser as well as by any scripting language that interacts with the document. It's essentially an API that translates the markup in an HTML document into a form that Javascript can understand. My understanding of the DOM is that it's organized like the document tree, with each element in the document forming a node that can be connected to other nodes via branches. I don't think I'll know what doesn't make sense about it until I have to start actually using it. It does seem a little clunky, but the hierarchical structure matches the way that HTML is organized.

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

The biggest difference is the amount of scripting on the wordpress site. I wasn't able to manipulate very many elements on the wordpress site, as opposed to my own where I had rather free reign. 

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?

I found them a mix of both. I had trouble getting the tools to select particular elements at times, and I found it somewhat confusing the navigate the document tree. However the ability to track down particular effects of css statements, and also to see which aspects are inherited and from where is pretty cool. 

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

I really liked learning about the console. Having played around with writing some simple Javascript scripts, it was very cool to see how you could use the Chrome Web Tools to debug scripts and check on the state of different variables for example. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
